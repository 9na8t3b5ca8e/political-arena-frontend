# Tailwind CSS Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Tailwind CDN**: The CDN script has been removed from `public/index.html` to fix the production warning.
2. **API Endpoint Fixes**: Fixed double `/api/` prefix issues in API calls.
3. **Income Endpoint Fix**: Corrected the income details endpoint to not pass user ID in URL.

## To Complete Tailwind CSS Installation

Run the following command in the frontend directory:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Then generate the Tailwind config file (already created for you):
```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Files Modified/Created

- ✅ `public/index.html` - Removed CDN script
- ✅ `src/index.css` - Added Tailwind directives
- ✅ `src/index.js` - Imported CSS file
- ✅ `tailwind.config.js` - Created config file
- ✅ `postcss.config.js` - Created PostCSS config
- ✅ `src/pages/HomePage.js` - Fixed API endpoint calls

## Next Steps

After running the npm install command above, the app should work without the Tailwind CDN warning and all API calls should work correctly.

## API Issues Fixed

1. **Game Parameters**: Changed from `/api/game/parameters` to `/game/parameters`
2. **Income Details**: Changed from `/income/details/${userId}` to `/income/details`

These changes align with how the backend routes are mounted in `server.js`.
