# HomePage Actions Migration & Capitalization Fixes

## Summary

Successfully moved Attack Opponent and Support Candidate actions from the HomePage to individual ProfilePages and fixed capitalization issues throughout the application.

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **1. HomePage Cleanup**
- ❌ **Removed**: `Attack Opponent` and `Support Candidate` actions from Campaign Operations
- ❌ **Removed**: Target user input fields and related state management
- ❌ **Removed**: Election state management (no longer needed for these actions)
- ✅ **Simplified**: CampaignActions component now only shows universal actions
- ✅ **Filtered**: Only shows `tv_advertisement` and `organize_rally` on homepage

### **2. ProfilePage Enhancement**
- ✅ **Added**: Attack Opponent button when viewing other users' profiles
- ✅ **Added**: Support Candidate button when viewing other users' profiles  
- ✅ **Added**: Action point validation and cost checking
- ✅ **Added**: Loading states and proper error handling
- ✅ **Added**: Game parameters integration for action costs
- ✅ **Added**: Icons (Zap for Attack, Heart for Support)
- ✅ **Added**: Tooltips explaining what each action does

### **3. Capitalization Fixes**
- ✅ **Fixed**: "Pac" → "PAC" (Political Action Committee)
- ✅ **Fixed**: "Tv Advertisement" → "TV Advertisement"
- ✅ **Fixed**: Proper capitalization in backend name generation
- ✅ **Fixed**: Consistent naming throughout application

### **4. Backend Improvements**
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Action name generation with proper capitalization
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Better descriptions for each action type
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Cleaner API response formatting

## **New User Experience**

### **Before:**
- Attack/Support actions cluttered the main homepage
- Confusing target selection with raw user IDs
- Actions available everywhere, not contextually relevant

### **After:**
- ✅ Clean, focused homepage with only personal campaign actions
- ✅ Attack/Support actions appear contextually on other players' profiles
- ✅ Visual action buttons with clear icons and tooltips
- ✅ Proper validation (can't attack yourself, AP cost checking)
- ✅ Better UX with loading states and notifications

## **Technical Implementation**

### **ProfilePage Actions**
```javascript
// Attack Opponent
<button onClick={handleAttackOpponent}>
  <Zap size={16} /> Attack Opponent
</button>

// Support Candidate  
<button onClick={handleSupportCandidate}>
  <Heart size={16} /> Support Candidate
</button>
```

### **Validation**
- ✅ Only shows on other users' profiles (not your own)
- ✅ Checks if user has enough Action Points
- ✅ Validates against game parameter costs
- ✅ Proper loading states to prevent double-clicks

### **API Integration**
```javascript
await apiCall('/actions/campaign', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    action: 'attack_opponent',
    targetUserId: profileData.user_id
  })
});
```

## **Benefits**

1. **🎯 Contextual Actions**: Attack/Support actions now appear where they make sense
2. **🧹 Cleaner Homepage**: Homepage focuses on personal campaign building
3. **👥 Better UX**: Clear visual cues for political interactions with other players
4. **📝 Professional**: Proper capitalization (PAC, TV) looks more polished
5. **🔒 Safer**: Built-in validation prevents invalid actions
6. **📱 Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop
